For my visual argument, I decided to do a commentary on how people get sucked into their phones, and how their lives are in a way controlled by it. I knew almost immediately that I wanted to personify a phone in some evil way. The first step I needed to take was finding an image of someone looking at their phone where they were positioned in such a way that I could make something come out of the phone. Originally, I wanted to have the phone controlling the person like a marionette. Eventually I decided to just attach "wires" to the person because finding a marionette controller that I could use for free was proving to be too difficult. Once I had my idea finalized, I got to work on the shadowy figure that comes out of the phone. Just like the marionette controller, finding a shadow figure image for free wasn't going well. I decided to make my own. By combining a silhouette of a hand and a couple of blacked out cartoon snakes, I was able to make my own scary, shadowy figure.
 To create a focal point in my image, I decided that I wanted to have the phone illuminating the man's face while the rest of the image would be dark with the shadow lurking in the background. That's all that I had before the first preview, and it looked like this.

I wasn't super satisfied with this. It was a good start but it definitely didn't live up to the idea that I had in my head. My next step was making the illumination look better. To do this, I just drew a faint, light blue region around the mans head that I think looks pretty realistic. Much better than the triangle cut out that I had before. The next aspect that I moved on to was the puppet wires that I wanted to attach from the hand to the man. Just like nearly everything else that I tried to find, I couldn't find a free image for the wires, which lead me to try and draw my own. This also didn't go well, so I decided to use chains instead, which turned out really well. The chain image was originally straight so I needed to bend them to keep them from overlapping and also keep them out of the light. I attached them to the man, drawing in a little blood for the one attached to his arm. Around this point, I decided to shape the shadow a little differently, so I replaced one of my snake images with another from the same source. The most annoying part of this whole project was making a shadow effect that worked well. I eventually used a paintbrush tool that created the shadowy gradient that I was looking for. The last part was adding a message to have my argument be more explicit. This lead me up to the full draft review.
This is what I had at that point.

Judging from the note cards, I think my argument came across well. The main points of revision in these note cards were about the text. Olivia suggested that I replace the words "Don't be blind" with something else. She also suggested using "Don't become trapped" in its place, which I thought was way better than I originally had.
Here are the notecards.

I eventually shortened "become" to "be" and had this as my final draft.

I definitely think I meet all of the baseline criteria. To focus the viewers attention, I used contrasting colors to focus different parts of the image. I had way more than three layers. I used the blur tool to make the shadow figure look better. My message was clear based on the notecards. The font I chose worked well with the tone of the image. 
I also think that I met quite a few aspirational goals. The cage transform tool that I used to bend the chains was pretty complicated but turned out really nice. I used a folder to group together the many layers of the shadow figure. I overlapped the man and the shadow at different points to create a sense of depth. I created my own visual assets, this being the shadow figure that I made. I also think that everything that I made comes together in a seamless way.
Overall, I enjoyed this unit. Maybe not as much as the audio unit, but I think that's only because GIMP can be frustrating at times.
