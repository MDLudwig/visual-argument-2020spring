In this preview, I have what I consider to be a decent start on the visual argument project.
The whole idea around my argument is that people have their opinions influenced too much by the things that they see on social
media. So, for my design, I wanted to personify technology/social media to make a striking argument against the influence of social media.
To accomplish this, I decided to have a shadowy figure coming out of the phone that the man in my image is holding. To accomplish this,
I put together three different images into one to effectively create what I could not find easily on the internet. I found multiple images
of cartoon snakes that were blacked out, and I combined the two into a single, long shadow body. I also found a shadowy hand that I 
attached to that body that I made. I also found an image that I used to create a layer of shadow over the image, in which I cut out an 
area that will late be used to show the brightness of the phone. My bigger plans for this visual argument are to encorporate this shadow 
better. I want to have the shadow very dark near the edges of the image and get thinner as it gets closer to the persons phone. This way,
the shadow monster phone that I made will still be noticable. The idea behind this is, the man holding the phone doesn't realize this 
monster is there controlling him. I still need to find a way to make realistic looking puppet strings going from the hand to various parts
of the man, as well as add the text that will serve as the explicit argument. I originally thought of using the phrase "Think for yourself"
but I am open for change if I can think of something with more power. Honestly, I still have a lot to do. I have a very good idea of what
I want in my head, but it's proving to be quite challenging getting everything to work in GIMP. In the last unit, I found Audacity, and
sound in general, to be much easier to use. I'm sure I'll be able to figure everything out in the end though.
